# âš¡ Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Forecast short-term household energy usage using historical time-based patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Household Power Consumption Dataset (resampled to hourly mean).

## ðŸ”§ Steps
1. Parse and clean data.
2. Engineer time-based features (hour, weekday/weekend).
3. Compare **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **XGBoost** models.
4. Evaluate with MAE & RMSE.
5. Visualize actual vs. forecasted energy usage.

## ðŸ“Š Models Compared
- **ARIMA** (classical time-series)
- **Prophet** (additive regression model)
- **XGBoost** (tree-based ML model with feature engineering)

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Output
- Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE) printed in terminal.
- Forecast plot saved as `results/forecast_plot.png`.

## ðŸš€ Skills Gained
- Time series forecasting  
- Feature engineering  
- Model evaluation & comparison  
- Temporal data visualization
